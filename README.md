# Titanic-notebook

## Titanic Survival Prediction
This project is a basic machine learning notebook that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using historical data.

## About the Dataset
- The dataset comes from the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle.

- It includes information like:

Age

Sex

Passenger Class

Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Fare, etc.

## Goal of the Project
Use data analysis and machine learning to predict survival.

Understand which features are most important in determining survival.

Train a model like Logistic Regression and evaluate its performance.

## Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
